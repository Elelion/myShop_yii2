Folder and file structure
------------------------

    Only files that will be changed will be uploaded to the repository,       
    all files created when installing yii will not be filled in, so as not to
    clutter the repository.


Installation
---------

• If you still don't have composer, install It
[from here](http://getcomposer.org/)
<br>
• installing yii2 (basic)<br>
• Then we copy the current repository to ourselves via the 
  compositor(i.e. where already the basic template is expanded), 
  and we build it again through the compositor.


Run the project
--------------
Go to the browser and go to localhost \ basic_shop
